# Stayc

### Compatibility

stayc currently does not work in the edge runtime environments.

### Introduction

stayc is a simple scraper that gets quotes from websites like quotefancy and azquotes for now. You can easily get quotes by giving stayc the URL of a quotes page. For example, for quotes from Taylor Swift on azquotes, just use the URL `https://www.azquotes.com/author/14371-Taylor_Swift`. It's the same for quotefancy. stayc works with both ESM and CJS modules, making it useful for different JavaScript projects. More quote sites will be added in the future.

### Installation

```bash
npm install stayc
or
pnpm add stayc
```

### Usage

After installing stayc, you can start scraping quotes from supported sites like quotefancy and azquotes. Hereâ€™s how to use stayc in your JavaScript projects:

First, import stayc into your project file. You can use stayc with both module systems, ESM and CJS.

#### for ESM modules

```js
import { quotefancy, azquotes } from 'stayc'
```

#### for CJS modules

```js
const { quotefancy, azquotes } = require('stayc')
```

#### Example with azquotes:

```js
async function fetchAzquotes() {
  try {
    const quotes = await azquotes(
      'https://www.azquotes.com/author/14371-Taylor_Swift'
    )
    console.log(quotes)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching quotes:', error)
  }
}

fetchAzquotes()
```

#### Example with quotefancy:

```js
async function fetchQuotefancy() {
  try {
    const quotes = await quotefancy(
      'https://www.quotefancy.com/author/Taylor-Swift'
    )
    console.log(quotes)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching quotes:', error)
  }
}

fetchQuotefancy()
```

### Usage with TypeScript

You can import type of `quotefancy` and `azquotes` from stayc in TypeScript projects.

```ts
import { azquotes, Azquotes } from 'stayc'
// or
import { quotefancy, Quotefancy } from 'stayc'
```

When you import `Quotefancy` or `Azquotes`, you'll get the type of `quotefancy` or `azquotes` respectively.

### Response

When using stayc to fetch quotes from `azquotes` or `quotefancy`, the response will be an array of objects, each representing a quote. Here's what each object contains:

- `quote` (string): The quote.
- `author` (string): The author.
- `url` (string): The URL of the quote.
- `image` (string): The date of the quote.
